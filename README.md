# Cleaning-Opportunity-Atlas-Data
Cleaning Baltimore City and Washington DC publicly available data in order to track social mobility.

## Background
A core pillar of American culture is the concept of the [American Dream](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/american-dream.asp), an belief that "anyone, regardless of where they were born or what class they were born into, can attain their own version of success in a society where upward mobility is possible for everyone. The American Dream is achieved through sacrifice, risk-taking, and hard work, rather than by chance."  While the concept of the American dream is supported by our countries laws and politicians, the harsh reality of the situation which many poor Americans face is a stark contrast.

This project seeks to provide an in depth statistical analysis of social mobility in two major cities, Baltimore, MD and Washington DC.

In Baltimore, a poverty striken city with high homicide rates, social mobility is extremely low.  Out of the 100 largest cities in the United States, [poor males growing up in Baltimore](https://afro.com/baltimore-ranks-lowest-in-upward-mobility-for-poor-boys/) have the least chance of becoming financially successful and achieving upward mobility.  In a nation founded on the principles that hard work and dedication will lead to a successful future, this fact shows that our idealist perception often differs substantially from reality.

In Washington DC a similar situation exists. [DC children in the lowest 25th percentile of incomes](https://www.dcfpi.org/all/economic-mobility-dc-lower-neighboring-counties/) have a substantially higher chance of having lower incomes as adults.  When poverty is systematic and lasting, we know that our nations ideals of social mobility and equal opportunity is failing us.
